# Portfolio
## Description

The goal of this project was to develop a professional portfolio with tthe goal of display my skill set via the linked apps, past projects, and the webpage itself and to attract potential employers.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This webpage contains functional nav links that will take you to the three sections of About Me, Work, and Contact me. The primary work sample also functions as a link to a previous refactor I performed, and the navigation bar contains functional links that assist the user in contacting me.
